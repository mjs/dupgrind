# dupgrind

dupgrind takes the output from the [photodedupe](https://github.com/InexplicableMagic/photodedupe)
tool and runs a ad hoc web server which allows you to see visualise each set of
duplicate photos and delete the ones you don't want to keep.

The UI is keyboard driven for quick navigation and deletion.

## Status

This project is current in an utilitarian MVP state. It works just well enough
for my own purposes.
